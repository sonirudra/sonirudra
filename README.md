Hello, World! 👋 I'm RUDRA SONI from the colorful state of Gujarat, India 🇮🇳
At 23, I've embarked on a fascinating journey in the tech world. With a vibrant spirit of a self-learner, I dove into the depths of mobile app development and emerged with 2 years of hands-on experience in React Native. My learning path was unconventional; I secured a full-time job through relentless self-education and a passion for technology. 🚀

🌱 Growing Professionally
By day, I'm a dedicated mobile app developer, navigating the complexities of React Native. But the winds of change are blowing, and I'm steering my ship towards the exciting realm of iOS development with Swift and SwiftUI. My vision? To transition my primary tech stack from React Native to iOS, embracing the challenges and opportunities this journey brings.

💼 Business Mindset
Professionally, I wear a different hat. I'm not just about the job; I'm about the business. I believe in creating value, seizing opportunities, and making a tangible impact. The goal is not just to work but to build, innovate, and lead in the industry.

🌍 A Hodophile's Heart
When the laptops close and the code rests, my wanderlust awakens. I'm a hodophile at heart, with a love for exploring new places, cultures, and stories. Travel is my escape, my inspiration, and a reminder of the beautiful diversity of our world.

✍️ A Pen Fueled by Passion
In the quiet moments, you'll find me lost in thought, penning down poets and quotes. Writing is my solace, my way of capturing the fleeting moments and the profound emotions that travel and technology bring to my life.
